# To-Do List Web App

A simple and interactive To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add tasks, view them in a list, and remove completed tasks. The tasks are stored locally using `localStorage`, ensuring that they persist across page reloads.

## Features

- Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- Delete task with a simple button click.
- Local storage support to persist tasks across sessions.
- Clean and responsive user interface.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout using Flexbox.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity for adding/removing tasks and local storage functionality.

## Project Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NilanshuBasnet/TodoList.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Files Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the app.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet for the app’s visual design.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file to handle task addition, deletion, and local storage.

## How It Works

1. **Add Task**: The user can type a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list. Tasks are saved in the local storage to ensure persistence.
2. **Delete Task**: Each task has a delete button (represented by a bin icon). When clicked, the task is removed from the list, and the local storage is updated accordingly.
