# ✅ To-Do List Web App

A simple and interactive 📝 To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add tasks, view them in a list, and remove completed tasks. The tasks are stored locally using `localStorage` 📁, ensuring that they persist across page reloads.

## 🚀 Project Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NilanshuBasnet/TodoList.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## 📂 Files Structure

- `📄 index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the app.
- `🎨 style.css`: The stylesheet for the app’s visual design.
- `⚙️ script.js`: JavaScript file to handle task addition, deletion, and local storage.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **➕ Add Task**: The user can type a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list. Tasks are saved in the local storage to ensure persistence.
2. **🗑️ Delete Task**: Each task has a delete button (represented by a bin icon). When clicked, the task is removed from the list, and the local storage is updated accordingly.
